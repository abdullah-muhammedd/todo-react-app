# Todo-React-App

## Overview

The Todo-React-App is a project created to demonstrate the practical usage of the Todo API that I developed. As my first foray into building a React application, it might be a bit messy, but it serves as a valuable learning experience.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to learn React and explore its ecosystem. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and by creating this Todo app, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with React's core concepts, state management, and modern tooling. 

The other main purpose is to show my ![todo-api](https://github.com/abdullah-muhammedd/todo-api.git) and use it in a real app.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

1. **React**: The core of the application is built using React, allowing for the creation of a dynamic and interactive user interface.

2. **Vite**: Vite is used as a build tool for this project. It provides fast and efficient development, making it an excellent choice for modern web applications.

3. **Tenstack/React Query**: This library simplifies data fetching and state management in React applications. It helps in handling server state and data synchronization.

4. **Redux Toolkit**: Redux Toolkit is used for state management in this app. It streamlines the setup and usage of Redux, making it easier to manage the application's global state.

5. **Taillwind CSS**: For Stying

## Features

The Todo-React-App provides a simple yet functional set of features, including:

- Users can create accounts and login to their accounts 
- Adding new tasks to the todo list.
- Marking tasks as completed.
- Deleting tasks from the list.
- Updating tasks and adding subtasks
